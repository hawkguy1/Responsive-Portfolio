            <p>My name is Andrew Harringa, and am currently studying at the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp to become
                a full stack web developer. I am a graduate from the University of Iowa, with a Bachelor of Arts in Art with
                a focus in Graphic Design. With many hours logged on the computer for design projects, I feel I have a great
                grasp on a great user environment, as well as an aesthetically pleasing experience. With this specialty,
                I plan to breathe life into my current degree and expand into the capabilities of technology as we
                see it today. I am very excited to see what the future holds, also who and what I'll be working with in the
                future. I hope you enjoy my site!
                <br/> Contact me if you'd like more information! I'd love to hear from you!
                <br/> Thanks for stopping by!
